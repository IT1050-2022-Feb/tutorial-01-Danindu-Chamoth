## Exercise 1 - Calculations

Write a C program to input marks of two subjects. Calculate and print the average of the two marks.

 
## Exercise 2 - Selection

Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.

•	Input the distance the van has travelled
•	The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
•	The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.


e.g.

Distance -> 20
Amount = 20 x 50 = 1000


Distance -> 50
Amount = 30 x 50 + (50-30) x 40 = 2300

## Exercise 3 - Repetition

Write a C program to calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
Where n is a keyboard input.

e.g.

n -> 100
sum = 1+2+3+....+ 99+100 = 5050

n -> 1-
sum = 1+2+3+...+10 = 55

 
## Exercise 4 - Functions

Implement the three functions minimum(), maximum() and multiply() below the main() function.

Do not change the code given in the main() function when you are implementing your solution.

```c
int main() {
   int no1, no2;
   printf("Enter a value for no 1 : ");
   scanf("%d", &no1);
   printf("Enter a value for no 2 : ");
   scanf("%d", &no2);
   printf("%d ", minimum(no1, no2));
   printf("%d ", maximum(no1, no2));
   printf("%d ", multiply(no1, no2));
   return 0;
}```
